This repository will allow the user to obtain and/or validate specific recipes.

Three possible inputs are considered:
- You can ask for the recipe of a specific name (e.g. lasagna)
- You can ask for a recipe that includes a specific set of ingredients (e.g. bread, tomato, onion)
- You can input a recipe and ask the model to correct or improve it.
